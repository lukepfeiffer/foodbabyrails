#Hey man, good job getting this all done for us. I really appreciate it
#beyond what words can describe. You're a real bro.
#I'm really glad that this will all work out. How great is it

#I might go and delete and reword Brandon's comments so that 
#the deletion numbers are up there as well. Sweet.

#Here's some more garbage for you.
