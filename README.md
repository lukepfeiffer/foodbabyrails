*** Folder Descriptions ***
app/ - Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs and assets for your application.

bin/ - Contains the rails script to start app and can contains other scripts to setup, update, deploy or run the application.

config/ - Configures the application's routes, database, and more.

config.ru - Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.

db/ - Contains current database schema, as well as the database migrations.

Gemfile and Gemfile.lock - These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for the Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem.

lib/ - Extended modules for the application.

log/ - Application log files.

package.json - This file allows you to specify what npm dependencies are needed for your Rails application. This file is used by Yarn.

public/ - The only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.

Rakefile - This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, add tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of the application.

README.md - Instruction manual - you're reading it.

test/ - Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus.

tmp/ - Temporary files (cache and pid files).

vendor/ - A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.
